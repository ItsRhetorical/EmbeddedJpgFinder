# EmbeddedJpgFinder

Python 3.6 

Searches file in binary looking for jpg images and extracts them into a folder (Images) in the same directory.
Images are numbered after the order they are found in the file in literal byte order

This was built and tested for pulling from a pdf, 
but would work in theory on any data structure containing jpgs that isn't encrypted or compressed.

This was as much a learning project about jpg and pdf formats and Python programming as anything so don't use this to parse mission critical jpgs on the moon or anything
